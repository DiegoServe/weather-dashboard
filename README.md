## Description

A fully functional weather dashboard app that lets you view the current and upcoming 5-day weather forecast for any city you are planning to visit.

## Usage

Simply type in any city you'd like in the left hand search bar and the 5-day forecast for that city will populate on the right hand side of the page.  Past searches can also be saved under the search bar for later or the user can clear it at anytime.  In addition to the 5-day forecast, current city specs such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind-Speed, and UV Index will also populate on the right side of the page above the 5-day forecast.
